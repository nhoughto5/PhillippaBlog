I think if I had a full 24 hours/day to fit in all of the positive wellness, health and fitness pursuits I wanted – I still wouldn’t have time for everything.  There’s just so much! HIIT for maximum cardiovascular health and weight maintenance, strength training for bone density and muscle building, yoga for mobility and relaxation, mindfulness for promoting peace, journaling for self-reflection, food prepping for optimal nutrition – where does one find time to work, raise a family and socialize?

The reality is we can’t do it all, but that doesn’t mean we should do nothing. Good health is one of our greatest gifts – we should all be doing our best to make sure health maintenance is a priority. 
Busyness is glorified in our culture – we’re all busy. Medical school was one of the busiest times in my life, but with goal setting and effective time management I was able to train for and compete in two bikini competitions. It is possible.

The first important part of the equation is to choose an attainable goal. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology recommends a minimum of 150 minutes/week of moderate-vigorous intensity exercise for overall health maintenance. That equates to three 50 minute sessions, five 30 minute sessions or any combination that suits your schedule. Will 150 minutes/week promote profound weight loss or turn you into the next great CrossFit athlete? Unlikely. But it will promote good health. 

If three sessions per week is all you can manage then you’re ahead of most. When relying on shorter training sessions you need to be purposeful in your choice of exercises, as well as your set and rep ranges to maximise the time you have. The best way to do this is with compound exercises, that is lifts or movements that use large muscles and multiple joints. Now is not the time for bicep curls. I’m talking squats, deadlifts, pushups, pullups, lunges, rows and anything plyometric.
Now, in terms of sets and rep ranges – we want to achieve an intensity somewhere between 6-8, so we’re looking to push your heart rate. Now is not the time for sets of five followed by two minutes recovery. We want to be aiming for rep ranges of 12-15, with a weight heavy enough to make that last rep a shaky, trembling struggle. Plan to do 3-4 sets/exercise and to really push your metabolism, circuits or supersets are the way to go.
	Here is an example of a metabolic conditioning circuit I may use when strapped for time, it’s full body and could easily be done three times per week.

***Warm-up – 5 minutes***

We’re doing a full body workout, so a full body warmup is ideal. Sometimes I’ll hop on the elliptical machine for 5 minutes, sometimes I will do a series of body weight exercises such as squats, lunges and pushups.

***Workout – 35 minutes***

Note exercises labeled, A,B,C etc are intended to be done as a circuit with no rest in between

|    | Exercise                         | Rep           | Sets |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------|------|
| 1A | Barbell squats                   | 15            | 3-4  |
| 1B | Pushups                          | 15            | 3-4  |
| 2A | Dumbbell walking lunges          | 15 (per side) | 3-4  |
| 2B | Romanian dumbbell deadlift       | 15            | 3-4  |
| 2C | Chinups (assisted if required)   | 15            | 3-4  |
| 3A | Kettlebell swings                | 15            | 3-4  |
| 3B | Box jumps or squat jumps         | 15            | 3-4  |
| 3C | Overhead dumbbell shoulder press | 15            | 3-4  |
| 3D | Bicycle crunches                 | 15 (per side) | 3-4  |

***Cool Down – 5 minutes***

Walk it off and full body stretch

No gym? No problem, many of these exercises can be modified for body weight or whatever equipment you have at home, babies make excellent weights for front squats too! In terms of carving out time for your workouts, I have always found that early morning training is the best way for me to stay committed to my goal. There are no other commitments or conflicts at 5:30 in the morning – aside from the call of my bed, but with time early mornings get easier (and a sunlight alarm clock helps too).
Training doesn’t have to be complicated, time consuming or confusing. So get off the couch and start moving, your health is your greatest gift and it takes effort to keep it that way, so start today.
