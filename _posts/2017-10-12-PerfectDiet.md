First of all – the perfect diet doesn’t exist and no one can guarantee you weight loss.  So if anyone is charging you a lot of money for a perfect diet plan, think about it carefully. The fact is, medical research has not clearly demonstrated that any particular diet plan is “the perfect diet plan” when it comes to weight loss. What we do know is that there are many great  (and not so great) “diets” on the market, all of which may promote weight loss in a particular individual – but the “perfect” plan doesn’t exist. That’s because the perfect plan depends on you. 

The perfect diet is one you can stick to. Forever. It’s not a 12-week fix or a 21-day challenge. It’s a lifelong change in your eating habits. It will promote initial weight loss and then eventually long term weight maintenance. It is a plan you can stick to 80% of the time, at home, at work, at parties and at restaurants. For some people that may mean cutting carbs, for others it may mean going vegan or counting macros. At the end of the day, weight loss is about energy balance, how you do that is less important. What does matter is that you choose a method that is safe, practical and fits into your lifestyle. 

When you look at large reviews of dietary evidence, one theme consistently emerges – be it low carb, low fat, plant based or whole food – calories are what count when it comes to weight loss. One study with over 800 participants randomly assigned dieters into four calorie restricted categories with differing ratios of fat, protein and carbs. They were followed for two years with regular reinforcement of the diet including group and individual counseling. The results showed that all four groups had clinically significant weight-loss. All four groups had improved fasting lipids and fasting sugar. The final conclusion of the study was that a diet successful in weight loss can be based on a range of macronutrient composition. This allows the diet to be tailored to the individual person promoting long-term success.  

The underlying truth of all of this is that weight loss is hard, but your diet should be simple. In general if you eat foods that come mostly from the earth and limit your consumption of processed foods and alcohol you’re doing alright. The finer details are up to you.
