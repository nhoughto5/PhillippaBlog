Spiritual health is a relatively new journey for me. As a child we grew up attending church on Sundays, Easter and Christmas.
We said grace sometimes. But as we got older, soccer games, swim meets and school activities started to press into our Sunday mornings – a common theme in busy families, I’m sure.

I don’t know if I ever actively considered myself a Christian growing up – I don’t think I really understood what that meant.
I knew I believed in God, and sometimes I would pray, often when worried or needing reassurance – but I didn’t really know where I fit into the bigger picture.
As I pursued scientific studies and met more and more people who rebuked religion all together, my sense of belonging in faith got less and less secure.
I started to feel like pursing science meant I wasn’t allowed to believe in anything.
But I did believe in something – I couldn’t really put it into words, but as I listened to people describe how sure they were that were was no spiritual world, something in my heart told me there was.
Medical school can be a confusing place to find your faith – we learn so much about science and physiology that it can be hard to see where religion fits in.
And yet for me, the more I learned about what makes us human, the surer I was that life is not a random occurrence.
But I still didn’t identify with any single belief system – just a strong feeling of faith in something.

It’s faith in something, anything, that has shown to matter when it comes to health and well-being.
In an evidenced based world, belief is a hard thing to understand – and yet, there is actually a lot of research out there that shows positive outcomes for people who identify with a spiritual system.
The term spirituality means different things to different people – for some it is organized religion, with a formal gathering place and rites of passage.
For others it may be finding meaning in meditation, nature, artwork or music.
At the end of the day, spirituality generally implies some kind of connection with a purpose outside of ourselves; it gives our lives a sense of meaning.

In terms of physical health, we know that identifying with a greater purpose has positive effects.
Religious or spiritual observance may prevent depression – spirituality fosters community, preventing social isolation and loneliness, which contributes to poor mental health outcomes.
Whether through organized church services or finding community through a yoga class, being a part of something bigger then yourself is good for you.
Prayer and meditation have been shown to result in both psychological and physiological changes that are positive for overall health.
Spiritual meditation has been found to lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, improve anxiety, enhance self-esteem and improve tolerance to pain (among many other benefits).

In the last year I have spent a lot of time reflecting on what I believe and where my values lie.
I worried that identifying as a Christian meant that I somehow lost a part of my medical self that I was giving up on evidence and going on faith alone.
But that’s not true. My personal journey in faith has no bearing on how I treat my patients, aside from the basic principles of love, kindness and compassion, which I think most people can agree are acceptable tenets to guide any profession.
